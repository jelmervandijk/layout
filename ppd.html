			<h2>OpTic Gaming enter Dota 2, sign The Dire</h2>
			<p>OpTic Gaming have entered Dota 2 with the signing of The Dire, the organization revealed on a stream Tuesday."In an unprecedented move, for the first time in OpTic history, we have stepped out of the FPS genre," OpTic COO Ryan Musselman said on stream. "Not that we're leaving the FPS genre, but now we're in Dota."

The Dire was originally formed during the post-TI7 roster shuffle in advance of the fall season. During their short existence, The Dire have qualified for the upcoming DOTA Summit 8 Minor by winning King's Cup: America, and most recently played in the qualifiers for ESL One Hamburg 2017 and PGL Open Bucharest 2017.

"I recently left my role as CEO of Evil Geniuses, and I've decided to take a step back and become a player once again," OpTic Gaming captain Peter "ppd" Dager said.

"I played professional Dota from 2014 to 2017, and I placed Top 3 at all The Internationals that I competed at. Last year I didn't play at all. But this year I thought it would be fun to give it another go. So I found a group of four guys and myself and we're out here doing out best. And OpTic contacted us and was interested in expanding outside of FPS, so we were happy to oblige."

	OpTic Gaming currently fields teams in CS:GO, Call of Duty, Halo and Gears of War. This is the organization's first foray into Dota 2.</p>
